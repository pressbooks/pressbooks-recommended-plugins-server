# Pressbooks Recommended Plugins Server

Welcome!

This repository contains the very simple serverless function that returns results for the Recommended Plugins tab in Pressbooks. It's adapted from the [original](https://github.com/secretpizzaparty/better-plugin-recommendations-server) by Secret Pizza Party.

Feel free to fork this repository to power your own server.

## Instructions

* Install [Node and NPM](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
* Install the project dependencies: `npm install`
* Start the Vercel dev server: `npm start`

## Adding Plugins

We welcome PRs which suggest useful plugins for Pressbooks environments by editing [plugins.txt](https://github.com/pressbooks/pressbooks-recommended-plugins-server/blob/master/plugins.txt). Criteria to be determined.
